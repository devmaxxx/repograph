# reset.sh — the one writable beauty-crm worktree put back to a known state before a writer arm.
#
# One directory holds every writer on this branch, so arms are sequential and each starts from
# whatever the last one left unless something puts the fixture's state back. This does: tracked
# edits reverted and untracked files removed (the store excepted — it is rewritten below), the
# pinned fixture's store copied in whole, and one --no-dense update to settle the stamps: the
# copied manifest carries the fixture's mtimes, which match nothing here,
# so that first walk hashes every file, finds every hash unchanged, records this tree's stamps,
# and every later walk is stat-only. `repograph-main` takes the no-op path on an unchanged tree
# and derives nothing, which is why the settle reads `changed 0` and is not a re-read.
#
# Which embedder the arm runs under is declared in the environment and refused when absent, so no
# writer here reaches for weights this machine does not hold; embedder.sh says why the declaration
# is not a file in the tree. The worktree it leaves has nothing untracked in it at all, which is
# what a `changes` row needs to map the one path it touched.
#
# Refuses with exit 2 and nothing touched unless WT is the locked, detached worktree at PIN and
# is not FIX — so a mistyped path cannot silently become the target. Exit 1 when the settle walk
# changed anything or its counts differ from the fixture's graph.json: the tree is not the one
# the store was built from, and nothing measured on it would be comparable.
#
# usage: REPOGRAPH_EMBED_MODEL=intfloat/multilingual-e5-small reset.sh
#        (FIX, WT, PIN and BIN from the environment too; the defaults are this machine's)
set -u
HERE="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
# Before the directories are resolved, so a session set up without the declaration is refused
# before anything is touched rather than after the store has been replaced.
