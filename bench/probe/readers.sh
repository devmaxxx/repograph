# readers.sh BINARY WORKTREE LOGDIR [N]
# The reader suite, N runs per row (default 5), in the one writable worktree straight after
# reset.sh has put the pinned fixture's store there, the resident server bypassed so every row is
# a cold process. Rows are the 2026-09-07 suite less `import-legacy`, which writes the store, and
# less `ask-stale`, which is every ask row now: every command that could walk the tree is read
# `--stale`, so no row refreshes stamps, rewrites a mirror or resyncs the index under the rows
# after it — the index moving under the suite is the cause G23 named — and the suite writes
# nothing, which the plan proves with the store's checksums before and after. `changes` needs a
# diff to read, so it touches one source file for the row's duration and moves the original back
# with its stamp (`cp -p`). Writes LOGDIR/summary.txt (one line per run) and LOGDIR/medians.txt.

# backup are untracked files in the tree the `changes` rows read — the row would measure the log
# directory it is writing, which is the defect the backup's own comment exists to prevent — while
# `judge.py medians` at the end read the near-empty file left in the original directory.

# The worktree too, and for a second reason: the EXIT trap below puts `cn.ts` back by `$F/$CN`, and
# it fires after this script has changed directory into `$F`. A relative WORKTREE then resolves
# against the worktree itself — `$F/$F/…` — so the restore misses and the appended line stays in
# the file, under every row of whatever runs next.
F=$(cd "$F" && pwd -P) || exit 2
# And the binary, for the first reason again: `measure.sh` runs `$B` after this script has changed
# directory into `$F`, so a relative BINARY resolves inside the worktree — every row exits 127 and
# `judge.py medians` refuses the suite, or, worse, a corpus that happens to carry `bin/repograph`
# gets measured instead of the candidate. A bare name is left alone: that one is a PATH lookup and
# means the same thing from either directory, and a path whose directory does not exist is left to
# fail where it is read rather than refused here.
