//! Which id families a repository has. A family is the prefix of any id the corpus *defines* —
//! a requirement line, its heading form, a milestone document, a registry row — so the documents
//! that already say it are the only place it is written down. Nothing here reads them a second
//! time to find out which they are: a definition is already a node, so the set is a view over
//! the graph (`of_graph`), and the only pass over the tree left is the mention tally that
//! `repograph families` prints beside it.
//!
//! Nothing configures this and nothing stores it. A default is the answer for a repository about
//! which nothing is known, and one corpus's list of families was never that answer for anybody
//! else's; a pin beside the graph would have been a second thing to keep in step with the
//! documents. The two losses are worth naming: a prefix a document only ever mentions —
//! `ISO-8601`, a ticket number, a year — is cited and then held aside rather than linked, and
//! there is no way to take a family away by hand. `repograph families` prints both halves so a
//! prefix on the wrong side of that line is something a reader can see.
